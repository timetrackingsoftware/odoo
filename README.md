TimeTracking-Gateway for Odoo
=============================
This project connects multiple time-tracking-software-solutions to Odoo.
An optimized interface implemented in Odoo allows the administration of time-tracking-related data.

Using replication-mechanisms punch-times from existing time-tracking-software will be available in odoo, can be edited and will be replicated.

It is planned to use Atlassian-Tools like Confluence and Jira to build a community in order to connect as much existing time-tracking-solutions as possible to Odoo.
